It is also known as Swedish massage or simply massage therapy.<\/p>\n<p>Massage therapists use long smooth strokes, kneading, and circular movements on superficial layers of muscle using massage lotion or oil.<\/p>\n<p>Swedish massage therapy can be very gentle and relaxing. If you've never had massage before, this is a good one to try first. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;Swedish massage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2) Aromatherapy Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Aromatherapy&nbsp;massage is&nbsp;massage therapy&nbsp;with the addition of one or more scented plant oils called&nbsp;essential oils&nbsp;to address specific needs.<\/p>\n<p>The massage therapist can select oils that are relaxing, energizing, stress-reducing, balancing, etc. One of the most common essential oils used in aromatherapy massage is&nbsp;lavender.<\/p>\n<p>Aromatherapy massage is particularly suited to stress-related conditions or conditions with an emotional component. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;aromatherapy massage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3) Hot Stone Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Heated, smooth stones are placed on certain points on the body to warm and loosen tight muscles and balance energy centers in the body.<\/p>\n<p>The massage therapist may also hold stones and apply gentle pressure with them. The warmth is comforting. Hot stone massage is good for people who have muscle tension but prefer lighter massage. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;hot stone massage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4) Deep Tissue Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Deep tissue massage targets the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue. The massage therapist uses slower strokes or friction techniques across the grain of the muscle.<\/p>\n<p>Deep tissue massage is used for chronically tight or painful muscles, repetitive strain, postural problems, or recovery from injury. People often feel sore for one to two days after deep tissue massage. Learn more about this style of massage in my article&nbsp;Deep Tissue Massage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5) Shiatsu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Shiatsu is a form of Japanese bodywork that uses localized finger pressure in a rhythmic sequence on acupuncture meridians.<br \/><br \/>Each point is held for for two to eight seconds to improve the flow of energy and help the body regain balance.<\/p>\n<p>People are normally pleasantly surprised when they try shiatsu for the first time. It is relaxing yet the pressure is firm, and there is usually no soreness afterwards. See my article on&nbsp;shiatsu.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6) Thai Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Like shiatsu, Thai massage aligns the energies of the body using gentle pressure on specific points. Thai massage also includes compressions and stretches.<\/p>\n<p>You don't just lie there--the therapist moves and stretches you into a sequence of postures. It's like yoga without doing any work. Thai massage is more energizing than other forms of massage. It is also reduces stress and improves flexibility and range of motion. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;thai massage. Also, see&nbsp;photos of a Thai massage&nbsp;session.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7) Pregnancy Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Also called prenatal massage, pregnancy massage is becoming increasingly popular with expectant mothers. Massage therapists who are certified in pregnancy massage know the proper way to position and support the woman's body during the massage, and how to modify techniques.<\/p>\n<p>Pregnancy massage is used to reduce stress, decrease swelling, relieve aches and pains, and reduce anxiety and depression. The massage is customized to a woman's individual needs. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;pregnancy massage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8) Reflexology<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although reflexology is sometimes called foot massage, it is more than simple foot massage. Reflexology involves applying pressure to certain points on the foot that correspond to organs and systems in the body. Reflexology is very relaxing, especially for people who stand on their feet all day or just have tired, achy feet. To learn more, read my article on&nbsp;reflexology.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9) Sports Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Sports massage is specifically designed for people who are involved in physical activity. But you don't have to be a professional athlete to have one-it's also used by people who are active and work out often. The focus isn't on relaxation but on preventing and treating injury and enhancing athletic performance.<\/p>\n<p>A combination of techniques are used. The strokes are generally faster than Swedish massage. Facilitated stretching is a common technique. It helps to loosen muscles and increase flexibility.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10) Back Massage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Some massage clinics and spas offer 30-minute back massages.

All the steps of a basic manicure are taken, except a special polish that requires curing under a UV light is applied. This cured polish typically lasts days longer than the polish used for a basic manicure, and is less prone to chipping.<\/p>\n<div class=\"image center\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Paraffin Manicure<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"image center\">\n<p>A\u00a0paraffin manicure\u00a0is a must for anyone with dry or overworked hands.

The manicure also includes a stimulating hand massage and finishes with a chic basic manicure polish look. Some paraffin treatments include the addition of various oils, like grape seed, for extra moisturizing benefits.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Hot Stone Manicure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you're dreaming of something ultra-pampering or want to give a great gift to a pal, consider a hot stone manicure.

A nail technician will apply a cream, oil, or lotion to the cuticles first, and place the hands into a dish of warm water for about five minutes to soak. After the soaking process is over and the cuticles have been tamed, the technician will dry the hand, and ask what nails and length you prefer. You can choose from square, oval, squoval (a combination of square and oval), or the popular stiletto shape.<\/p>\n<p>At this point in the manicure, the shape of the nails has been defined and it is time for a massage. When the massage has been completed, a base coat will be applied first. After that, a polish of your choice is applied usually twice. Last, a top coat is applied. Once the nails have been polished you will place your hands under a nail dryer to complete the drying process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>French Manicure<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>The ever-classic&nbsp;French manicure&nbsp;is destined to give you the clean, gorgeous look you want. A clear, pale pink or beige polish is applied over the entire nail, and white polish along the tip. The end result is healthy, vibrant and perfect for all occasions - you definitely can't go wrong with this look.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"image center\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div class=\"image center\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div class=\"image center\"><strong>American Manicure<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>An&nbsp;American manicure&nbsp;is similar to the French, but the shape and color of the nails differ. In the American manicure the tips are sometimes rounded, and use more neutral or off white colors on the tips, instead of the drastic bright whites used in the French manicure.<\/p>\n        <h2><span><\/span><\/h2>\n        \n        <h2><span><\/span><\/h2>\n        \n        ","broadcast":"0","published":"1","featured":"0","archived":"0","type":"internal","created_at":"2014-06-24 05:46:31","updated_at":"2014-08-11 09:07:54","external_id":null,"user_id":"1"},{"id":"2","page_id":"7","metaData":"{\"h1\":\"Type of massage\",\"title\":\"Type of massage\",\"navName\":\"Type of massage\",\"url\":\"type-of-massage-1404742215.html\",\"teaserText\":\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod\\ntempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It is also known as Swedish massage or simply massage therapy.<\/p>\n<p>Massage therapists use long smooth strokes, kneading, and circular movements on superficial layers of muscle using massage lotion or oil.<\/p>\n<p>Swedish massage therapy can be very gentle and relaxing. If you've never had massage before, this is a good one to try first.
